# Publish to Chocolatey
#
# This workflow creates and submits a package to the Chocolatey Community Repository.
# It is designed for portable applications distributed as ZIP files.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Release artifacts must be ZIP files with the following structure:
#     MyApp.zip
#     â””â”€â”€ MyApp/
#         â””â”€â”€ MyApp.exe
#   - Each architecture should have its own ZIP file (x86, x64)
#   - ZIP names should follow the pattern: {name}_v{version}_{arch}{suffix}.zip
#
# Usage:
#   1. Automatic (via release):
#      - Create a new release in your repository
#      - The workflow will run automatically with default settings
#
#   2. Manual (workflow_dispatch):
#      - Go to Actions -> Publish to Chocolatey -> Run workflow
#      - Required inputs:
#        * Version: The version to publish (e.g., v1.0.0)
#      - Optional inputs:
#        * File suffix: Added to the end of artifact names (default: _Net9.0_FrameworkDependent)
#        * Architectures: Comma-separated list of architectures (default: x86,x64,arm64)
#
# Note: 
#   - Requires CHOCOLATEY_API_KEY secret to be set in repository settings for pushing to Chocolatey
#   - If your ZIP structure is different, modify the chocolateyinstall.ps1 template
#     in the packages/chocolatey/templates directory
